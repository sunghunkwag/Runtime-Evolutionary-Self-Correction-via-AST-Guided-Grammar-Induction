# Recursive-Self-Improvement-Engine-BETA

An autonomous AI engine capable of improving its own source code and evolutionary logic at runtime.

## 📌 Status
**Current Version**: `L2_UNIFIED_RSI.py` (Meta-Logic Grade)
- **Turing Complete**: Evolves full Python code (Loops, Ifs, Variables) ✅
- **Meta-Engine**: Evolves its own learning algorithm (Selection/Crossover) ✅
- **Infinite Loop**: Running in continuous self-improvement mode ✅

##  How to Run

### Windows (Recommended)
Double-click **`run_infinite_rsi.bat`** to start the infinite optimization loop.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE FOR DOWNLOADERS:**
> 1. You must download **BOTH** `run_infinite_rsi.bat` AND `L2_UNIFIED_RSI.py`.
> 2. Place them in the **SAME FOLDER** (e.g., Downloads).
> 3. Ensure Windows didn't save the python file as `.txt` (e.g., `L2_UNIFIED_RSI.py.txt`). Remove `.txt` if present.

### Command Line
```powershell
python L2_UNIFIED_RSI.py rsi-loop --generations 500 --rounds 100
```

## 🛠️ System Architecture

| Component | Description | Status |
